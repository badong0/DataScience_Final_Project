# Archive: Modeling Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks that were part of the initial project scope but are not part of the core data science analysis focus.

## Contents

- `4predictive_model.ipynb` - Random Forest Regressor for Focus_Rating prediction (Future Work / Optional)
- `5mlr_analysis.ipynb` - Multiple Linear Regression for Mood_Rating and Focus_Rating prediction (Future Work / Optional)

## Note

These notebooks implement machine learning modeling techniques but are **not part of the core analysis** which focuses on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Analysis (ANOVA, correlation, chi-square)
- Pattern Identification through clustering
- Hypothesis Testing

These modeling notebooks are kept for reference but are not required for the main data science project deliverables.
